				A team of engineers at Syracuse University are designing a way to further understand, and hopefully predict, harmful algal blooms by installing sensors in the watershed. 
				<br/><br/>

				The team is headed by Svetla Todorova, an environmental engineering professor who started the project last year on a CUSE grant. She wanted to design a sensor that would be inexpensive, but still get the job done — current sensors on the market cost upwards of $5,000. Hers is around $300.

				<br/><br/>

				Todorova partnered with Bill Tetley, an electrical engineering professor. He took Todorova’s ideas and designed the technicalities of the sensor box, allowing it to collect data on an SD card.

				In summer 2019, the team put out their first and only sensor box on a creek leading into Skaneateles Lake, the oligotrophic lake that provides water for the City of Syracuse under a filtration avoidance waiver, meaning the water is relatively untreated. Skaneateles Lake experienced its first HAB in 2017, and since then, watershed community members have worked tirelessly to find out more about their water quality — to install a water treatment plant now would cost millions of dollars. 

				<br/><br/> 

				This summer, the team plans to install five sensors. They’re working closely with members of the Skaneateles Lake Association to determine which creeks will be monitored with the sensors. 

				<br/><br/>

				“I’m quite excited about this project,” Todorova said in February 2020, a few months before her team will deploy the next sensors. “I started with a lot of expectations, and then lowered my expectations, but now we’re at the point that I know we can do it. And that excites me because we can contribute to a bigger cause.” 

				<br/><br/>

				Last summer, the team almost lost their prototype because an October storm — “a storm from hell,” Todorova described it as, flooded the watershed with high flows and washed the sensor downstream. Luckily, a community member picked the sensor up for them before it was completely lost. Tetley spent the Fall 2019 semester cleaning the sensor, and determining if it could be used again. Storms are the most important time to monitor creeks, since that’s when the most nutrients get washed into the lake — this year, Todorova and Tetley are determined to find a solution to securing the sensors, while still being able to install and uninstall them seasonally. 

				<br/><br/>

				Once the sensor was clean, Tetley could begin testing its usefulness again. In February 2020, he had the sensor up and running. The sensor uses multiple circuit boards to collect and store data. 

				<br/><br/>

				The sensor can also collect data on levels of ammonium, nitrate and phosphate. These graphs, created by Zhang, show a time series of nutrient levels in Five-mile Creek, the creek the team monitored summer 2019. The three increases in concentrations, observed March 11, June 16 and June 20, 2019, correspond to precipitation events.

				Funding from the university ended in April, but the project received funding until December from the Central New York Community Foundation in Syracuse. Todorova said she doesn’t see the project going away anytime soon — as long as she still has funding, she’ll keep developing the sensors. She’ll keep working with students, too, in the Syracuse University engineering lab, both to lower the cost of the research and to incite student knowledge. 

				<br/><br/>

				“I think it’s a great project because it involves the community,” Mario Montesdeoca, the lab manager at Syracuse University, said. “It allows the community to own the project, and they have an investment.” 

				<br/><br/>

				This isn’t the only project concerning Skaneateles Lake water quality to come out of Syracuse University. Charlie Driscoll, a member of Todorova’s team, a professor in the College of Engineering and a board member of the Skaneateles Lake Association, oversees two other projects. One measures rain water chemistry, and the other characterizes sediments in the lake. For the sensor project, he collects water samples to be tested in the SU lab. 

				<br/><br/>

				All of these are attempts to gain further knowledge of what nutrients are in the lake, and at what levels those nutrients trigger HABs. The cyanobacteria in the blooms are present in most freshwater lakes and streams around the world — the bacteria is over three billion years old, and helped create Earth’s atmosphere. But only recently have we discovered its potential for toxicity and compromising otherwise clean water sources. By monitoring the watershed, projects like Todorova’s will enable water managers the ability to predict and treat HABs.
