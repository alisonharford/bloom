				Hilary Lambert blames the farms. 

				<br/><br/>

				Lambert is the executive director of the Cayuga Watershed Network, which oversees Cayuga Lake, the second-largest of the Finger Lakes. The lake has suffered from harmful algal blooms (HABs) every summer since its first in 2017. 

				<br/><br/>

				In the years she’s worked in this position, she has become more radicalized in her thinking, she said. As she watched other lakes in the state explode with blooms, she kept hoping hers wouldn’t suffer. But in 2017, following a major storm, the first bloom appeared.  

				<br/><br/>

				“We were late to the party,” she said. “We were living in a dream world.” 

				<br/><br/> 

				Lambert blames agriculture runoff as the reason more and more nutrients have been washing into her lake and encouraging the algal blooms — nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate, which are  

				<a href="https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions" class="storylink" target="new">emitted </a>

				mostly by agricultural and urban runoff. She’s suspicious of anyone who points blame elsewhere. 

				<br/><br/>

				“Hilary, they are gonna try to tell you it’s this or it’s that, they’re gonna dodge around and say it’s something other than what it really is, which is too much nutrient flowing into the water body,” she said of the scientific community that study effects of climate change as the reason algal blooms appear each year.

				<br/><br/>

				And that’s true. The 

				<a href="https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/climate-change-and-harmful-algal-blooms" class="storylink" target="new">Environmental Protection Agency</a>

				, the

				<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/habs/environment.html" class="storylink" target="new"> Center for Disease Control and Prevention</a>

				and the 

				<a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/why_habs.html#:~:text=Harmful%20algal%20blooms%20(HABs)%20occur,%2C%20marine%20mammals%2C%20and%20birds.&text=People%20often%20get%20sick%20by,toxins%20produced%20by%20these%20algae." class="storylink" target="new">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association</a>

				have all written that higher temperatures and more intense weather events do increase the likelihood that a toxic algal bloom will appear. According to Bob Werner, a lake ecologist in New York State, HABs require sunlight, warm water (but below 90ºF), low turbidity, stable conditions and an excess of nutrients, primarily nitrogen and phosphorus. Nutrients get into the lake by washing in, usually from agricultural fields and most prominently after large rainstorms. Whether one of those conditions influences a bloom more than the others is still up for debate, and could also be different in each waterbody — each separate community has to do its own assessment of factors. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, or solution, according to 

				<a href="http://ongov.net/planning/haz/documents/Section5.4.5-HABFINAL.pdf" class="storylink" target="new">risk assessments</a>

				 supplied by New York State counties.

				<br/><br/>

				The only thing watershed networks or lake associations can control of those factors is how many nutrients have the possibility to be washed into their lakes. They can control, or at least fight for, the 

				<a href="https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions" class="storylink" target="new">regulation </a>

				of things such as septic tanks or fossil fuels or agricultural fields and manure lagoons. They cannot control the weather. 

				<br/><br/> 

				Paul Torrisi, president of the Skaneateles Lake Association, doesn’t point fingers. 

				<br/><br/>

				"Everybody's got a piece of the action,” he said. “Farmers, the people who live on the lake, the people who use the lake, the people who live in the watershed, everybody's contributing to pollution.” 

				<br/><br/>

				"It can be so easily misinterpreted,” he said. “And that leads to frank warfare."

				<br/><br/>

				The blame can’t be totally on the farmers, because in Torrisi’s eyes, that problem has already been solved. In 1994, following an increase in cases of giardia, the city of Syracuse worked with Skaneateles to develop the Skaneateles Lake Watershed Agricultural Program (SLWAP), set up through Onondaga County Soil and Water. The

				<a href="https://www.ocswcd.org/slwap.html" class="storylink" target="new">program</a> 

				, still in effect today, aims to “carry-out a cost-effective, innovative program for the farming community that upholds the high drinking water quality standards of Skaneateles Lake,” according to its website. When a farm volunteers to work with the program, they develop a set of “Best Management Practices,” such as sediment control, that help maintain the water quality downstream. As of December 2019, 38 of the 45 total farms within the Skaneateles Lake watershed have voluntarily enrolled.  

				<br/><br/>

				“People are very quick to point the fingers at farms,” Torrisi said. “But there’s been this 25 year history of this agricultural program that’s been ongoing and very successful, and so that’s not the only problem.” But the program doesn’t fix everything — a

				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om9Pdiub7ek&feature=youtu.be" class="storylink" target="new">study</a> 

				 on nutrient levels in Skaneateles Lake Tributaries, conducted by the Upstate Freshwater Institute, found that phosphorous levels were highest in tributaries in agricultural areas. All programs like this can do is lower the nutrient levels, not stop them completely. 

				<br/><br/>

				Programs like this are appearing in watersheds across the state, but they work slowly and only locally. There’s a lack of watershed communities working together, Lambert said, exacerbated by how difficult it’s been to secure funding from the 

				<a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-action-plans-combat-harmful-algal-blooms" class="storylink" target="new">$65 million </a>

				that was promised by Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, in 2018 to research and combat HABs. Lambert hasn’t received any money. The Skaneateles Lake Association (SLA), too, has found it hard to tap the governor’s funding: it hasn’t received any money either, and “it’s been a long, lengthy process,” Frank Moses, executive director of the SLA, said.  

				<br/><br/>

				Currently, the Cayuga Lake Watershed Network

				<a href="https://www.cayugalake.org/resources/water-resource-committee/" class="storylink" target="new">Water Quality Committee </a>

				is focusing its efforts on reviewing septic practices, understanding best management practices for agriculture (and where they are and are not being used), and is planning to launch a stormwater sampling project this year. The objective is to identify and estimate nutrient loadings of inflows to the lake. 

				<br/><br/>

				It’s the most the watershed network can do, for now. 

				<br/><br/>

				HABs, which have a predicted 

				<a href="http://ongov.net/planning/haz/documents/Section5.4.5-HABFINAL.pdf" class="storylink" target="new">100% chance </a>

				of occurring each year, are a harbinger of more serious impacts to the water quality in the state, Lambert said. People assume they will have “unlimited, free, high-quality water forever and ever,” she said. 

				<br/><br/>

				“And I’m breaking the news to them, and they say well, someone will come fix it, and I say well, they can, but will they?,” she said. “And so we’ll continue.”
